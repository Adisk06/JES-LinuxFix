Requirements
------------
This is a Windows package of JES, without an included Java Runtime
Environment. To use it, you need to have a JRE already installed.
Oracle provides instructions for checking if you have a JRE at

If you need to download and install a JRE, you can do so at
<https://www.java.com/en/>.

All of JES's other dependencies are included in this ZIP file.
You just need a working Java Runtime Environment.


Running JES
-----------
To start JES, find where you extracted the ZIP file, then double-click the
JES.exe file (its icon has the face of a python on it).

You can keep track of JES development, download the latest version,
