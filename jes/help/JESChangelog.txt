JES Changelog
=============
This changelog only covers changes in JES versions 5.0 and later.
Our records of what changed in version 4.3 and earlier are fragmentary.


JES 5.0
-------
Release Date: Pending (expected in August 2014)

Supervisor: Mark Guzdial

Primary Developer: Matthew Frazier

Contributors: Christine Alvarado

### User Interface Improvements

*   Allow the color scheme of the command window to be switched.
    Several new themes are included, many which print function return
    values in a different color than `print` output.
    The yellow-on-black JES 4.3 theme remains the default, however.

*   Instead of displaying `java.lang.ThreadDeath`, stopping the program
    while it's running displays a simple message,
    `[The program was stopped by the stop button.]`

*   Added a `Clear command window` option to the `Edit` menu, which
    empties the command window of all text (but preserves history and defined
    variables).

*   Moved settings into a `.properties` file, which is stored in the
    user's platform-specific preferences directory.
    (Previously, settings were stored in a delicately-formatted `.txt`
    file stored in the root of the user's home directory.)

*   Made version information available in the Command Window:
    type `version` to print out the JES, Java, and Jython versions.
    More detailed version information is also provided on the splash
    screen.

*   Allowed the name of a script file to edit to be passed on JES's
    command line.

*   Added code to handle I/O errors that happen while opening files
    (such as insufficient access).

### Media API Improvements

*   Renamed `setLibPath` to `addLibPath`, since there can be more than one
    library path. (The old name still works.)

### Interpreter Improvements

*   Upgraded to Jython 2.5, granting access to new Python language
    features and providing a significant speedup for many programs.

*   Rewrote the interpreter threading code to avoid race conditions
    and provide better isolation from the GUI.

*   Displayed printed messages on the command window immediately,
    thus making the `printNow` function unnecessary.
    (It has not been removed, however.)

*   Cleaned up exception display and message extraction.

*   Added the `__file__` variable to the interpreter context,
    allowing the JES test suite to be executed from within JES.

### Development Workflow Improvements

*   Reorganized the JES repository layout, to separate the Java code,
    Python code, static resources, and unit tests into separate
    directories.

*   Created an Ant Buildfile to fully automate the build and release
    process, including the construction of Windows installers and
    Mac OS X .app packages.

*   Added debugging switches for testing JES and reporting system
    information. (See `working-on-jes/launching-jes.md` for details.)

*   Added a `debugJES()` function that, when called, returns the
    instance of `JESProgram` for debugging purposes.

*   Created a "testing kit" which users can download to run JES tests
    and demo programs on a release version of JES.

*   Started signing released JAR files.

*   Added Jason Kirtland's "Blinker" library for internal use.

*   Deleted massive quantities of unused code.

### Bug Fixes

*   Corrected the spelling of "Loading Program."
    (Previously, it was "Loading Progam.")

*   Fixed the Watcher's speed slider and stop buttons.
    Now, they function as intended on all platforms.

*   Fixed the "Remove Variable" button in the Watcher.

*   Made the Watcher change UI skins with the rest of the application,
    and corrected the appearance of the buttons on non-Metal skins.

*   Moved all GUI-construction code in the startup phase to the Event
    Dispatch Thread, eliminating at least one random crash bug.

*   Fixed `SimplePicture`'s extension-detecting code to split on the
    last dot in the filename instead of the first.

*   Corrected SimpleTurtle to use 0.5-based rounding instead of
    truncation. (Thanks to Christine Alvarado from UC San Diego for
    discovering this bug and contributing a patch!)

*   Removed the occasional duplicate `>>>` prompts in the Command
    Window.

*   Prevented `...` prompts in the Command Window from being
    backspaced over.

*   Deleted unnecessary `print` statements.

### Removed Functionality

*   Removed the Turnin system. User surveys revealed that it is no
    longer in use, and it may not have functioned to begin with.
    The Web-CAT submission engine may be integrated in the future to
    provide a replacement.
